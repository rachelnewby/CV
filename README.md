## :woman_cartwheeling: Skills

**Strategic:** Able to see the bigger picture and ask the important questions.<br>
At McKesson UK, I did a full review of the company website ahead of the sale of the business. I sourced and analysed Google Analytics data which showed that key pages demonstrating the business's value offering weren't being visited. After thoroughly researching the requirements of the business and needs of target audiences, recommendations were implemented to improve the readability and navigation of the website to ensure the business's most important messages were communicated effectively. 

**Creative:** Developing creative solutions to solve a variety of different challenges.<br>
At Auto Trader, I found a solution to display dense, content-heavy reports on our corporate website. To make the content engaging and accessible, I worked with an external agency to build additional modules which would make the reports interactive. My role was to make sure the business's needs were met, test the solutions, and deliver the requirements on time. The solution resulted in a significantly larger readership than on previous pdf reports, and we reused the modules across the site to improve overall engagement online. 

**Team player:** Collaborate with others to share skills and knowledge.<br>
During my time at Makers, we took part in multiple group projects, including building a FaceBook clone. We inherited an existing codebase and had to use technologies we weren't familiar with. As a team, we were committed to learning and knowledge sharing, making sure everyone understood the code, and taught each other new tech skills. This empathetic and collaborative approach culminated in a successful MVP which had eight new features built into it, and meant our team fully grasped React, JavaScript, and Mongodb. 

**Communication:** Understand complex topics and simplify them for wide audiences.<br> 
At the University of Roehampton, I read and dissected research papers, and crafted relatable stories which I pitched to the media. This gained significant press coverage and highlighted the impact of the work the University of Roehampton had on communities globally. Topics included chicken husbandry, and the use of benzodiazepines. 

**Attention to detail:** Keen eye for the little - and big - things.<br>
At Auto Trader, I was responsible for writing and editing parts of the annual report, which had strict requirements. I meticulously followed the guidelines to ensure each requirement was reported on succinctly, and all the information was captured, and verified. I proofread the document to edit grammatical errors and typos. Attention to detail was vital to ensure we were reporting accurately and efficiently. 

**Calm under pressure:** Able to keep a clear head and mitigate risk.<br>
At McKesson UK, I managed urgent press enquiries on sensitive issues; journalists would require statements on issues within two or three hours. I acted fast and worked with colleagues to understand the root of the issues, came up with effective responses, and liaised with senior staff to ensure the solutions were implemented. This was carefully articulated to the press to mitigate risks.
